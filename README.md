Flugplatzdaten Segelflug CH


This project adresses a common problem in VFR flight: outdated aeronautical information.
Glider pilots in particular are prone to doubtful sources, often sharing unofficial information collected by enthusiasts and aficionados. Moreover information is then distributed in file formats making it very difficult to take on periodical updates.

landables_ch seeks to have swiss airfield data up to date.
This is done with a novel approach by separating visual representation (PDF) from aeronautical information (XML).
For the sake of simplicity Adobe Indesign is used to process data and to generated the output.
